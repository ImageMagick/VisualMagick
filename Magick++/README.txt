Magick++ has a large number of demo and test files that can be found
in ImageMagick\Magick++\demo, and ImageMagick\Magick++\tests.

You can have any of these programs added to your build configuration
by simply dragging them into their corresponding folder in

ImageMagick\Magick++\demo, or ImageMagick\Magick++\test.

After running the configure program, you should see projects for all
of the programs you have added which will now be part of the entire
build procedure.

You can also use this technique for your opwn development if you wish.
When creating a new application, simply grab one of the demos or test
programs that is close to what you wish to do, rename it, and drop
it into the demos or tests folder to get an appropriate project file.
